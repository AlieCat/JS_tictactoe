JS_tictactoe
============

A JavaScript "tic-tac-toe" game. Task outline from Odin Project.com.

I created this tic tac toe game (we call it noughts and crosses in the UK) using some of the theory
behind the snake app in my other repo. I've used our pet cats to represent the players of the game.
("Sox" and "Snowy" - if you wondering and find reference to them in the code) Having created the game from scratch I'm pleased with the result, the JS code could probably do with some re-factoring but
everything seems to work.
